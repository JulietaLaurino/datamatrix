title: Install

## Dependencies

`DataMatrix` runs on Python 2 and 3, and requires only the Python standard library. However, in most cases you'll want to install also `numpy` (required for some functions) and `fastnumbers` (improves performance).

## Installation

The easiest way to install `DataMatrix` is through PyPi (`pip install`):

~~~
pip install python-datamatrix
~~~

Optional dependencies:

~~~
pip install fastnumbers numpy
~~~
