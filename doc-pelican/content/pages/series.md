## What are series?

A `SeriesColumn` is a column with a depth; that is, each cell contains multiple values. Data of this kind is very common. For example, imagine a psychology experiment in which participants see positive or negative pictures, while their brain activity is recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Here, picture type (positive or negative) is a single value that could be stored in a normal table. But EEG activity is a continuous signal, and could be stored as `SeriesColumn`.
