## About

The `datamatrix` package provides a high-level, intuitive way to work with
tabular data, that is, datasets that consist of named columns and numbered rows.

The main advantage of `datamatrix` over similar libraries is the clean, Pythonic syntax, which makes your code easy to read and understand.

## Dependencies

Most of `datamatrix` requires only the Python standard library. However, to use the `FloatColumn`, `IntColumn`, and `SeriesColumn` objects, you need `numpy` and `scipy`.

## Usage

See the included IPython notebook for examples of how to use `datamatrix`:
